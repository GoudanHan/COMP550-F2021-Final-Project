In this report, we investigate the feasibility of nine machine learning classifiers, a deep learning model Long Short Term Memory classifier (LSTM) and a transfer learning-based language model ALBERT to detect hate speech in English Tweets. The machine learning classifiers we implement and compare are following: Decision Tree Classifier, Linear SVC, Ada Boost Classifier, Bagging Classifier, Logistic Regression, SGD Classifier, KNeighbors Classifier, Ridge Classifier, and MultinomialNB. Furthermore, we investigate the use of LSTM and ALBERT, on hate speech detection problems. After sampling and balancing Twitter dataset taken from several sources, different sizes of dataset were used to train the models in our experiments. We sampled six balanced datasets of 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 50,000 tweets annotated by crowdsourcing, respectively, which all contain 50% hate speech, 50% non-hate speech. The relationship between performance of deep learning models and transfer learning-based models with the size of the dataset is explored as well. The experiments showed that the ALBERT model achieved a 0.714286 f1-score and 0.875 accuracy based on the dataset containing 50,000 annotated tweets, which outperformed other models. However, when the ALBERT model is trained on small datasets, it is not as good as some other common traditional machine learning classifiers.
